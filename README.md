## Search Functionality

The project includes a search functionality that allows users to search for books by their title.

### How It Works:

- The user enters a book title into the search input field and presses the "Enter" key.
- The system displays a loading spinner while it fetches data from the API.
- If books matching the search query are found, they are displayed along with their authors and cover images.
- If no books are found, a "No results found" message is displayed.

### Key Features:

- **Dynamic Search:** Fetches real-time data from an external API based on user input.
- **Loading Indicator:** Displays a spinner while waiting for the search results.
- **User-Friendly Display:** Shows book covers and authors, making it easier for users to find what they are looking for.
